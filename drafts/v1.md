# Cyberbuddhism

Cyberbuddhism changes your life by changing your pleasure system. In the new system, you derive pleasure from following the plan - not from the results, and not from the process. This works because we naturally seek pleasure, and changing the pleasure system changes our behavior.

For example:

Alice resolves to run in the morning, but she doesn't do it.


You make a plan to run every day in the morning. If you're not an avid runner, you might not be able to run the full distance (can't derive pleasure from the result). Also, your legs might hurt, and you might have heart palpitations (can't derive pleasure from the process). But you will definitely, surely execute an action according to your plan (can always derive pleasure from following the plan).



The main axiom: "Derive pleasure from following the plan, not from results of doing things, not from the process of doing things."

## Example

Alice wants to be fit & eat ice-cream.
